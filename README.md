## How to get started

+ Clone this repo into a new folder and open console in this folder
+ Check if you have `node` and `npm` already installed
+ Run `npm install` to install local packages
+ Run `grunt make` to build the app; it will be located in `./dist` folder
+ Run `node ./server.js` to have the app served
+ Open http://localhost:9000 in Chrome to check if the app works
+ To see how the app works inside Eikon:
  + Open Refinitiv Eikon
  + Open menu, select `Developer` and open `App Studio Web Browser`
  + Enter http://localhost:9000 into window's address bar hit Enter (in some cases this does not work; for this occasion first open app in your browser and then in Eikon in the way described above)
